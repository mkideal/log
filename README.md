## Project Status: Archived

**This project is no longer actively maintained.**

We recommend using the `log/slog` package from the Go standard library as a more robust and actively maintained alternative for structured logging.

For more information, please refer to the [official Go documentation for log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).

Thank you to all who have used and supported this project.
